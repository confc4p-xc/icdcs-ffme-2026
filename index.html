          This workshop explores the challenges of training, adapting, and deploying foundation models in distributed (federated) edge environments. As large language and multimodal models increasingly move from centralized clouds toward edge and near-edge infrastructures, assumptions of abundant resources, stable connectivity, and centralized control no longer hold. While federated learning provides a privacy-preserving framework for collaborative model adaptation, existing approaches have not been designed to support foundation models operating across heterogeneous, resource-constrained, and intermittently connected edge systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          This workshop focuses on theoretical and algorithmic design challenges at the intersection of federated learning, on-device foundation models, and edge computing, including but not limited to scalability, communication efficiency, heterogeneity and non-IIDness, personalization, security and privacy risks, and operational issues in large-scale deployment. Emphasizing cross-layer perspectives, the workshop seeks contributions that examine fundamental trade-offs between model capability, system efficiency, robustness, and privacy. Its timing is particularly relevant as regulatory pressure, latency-sensitive applications, and on-device intelligence demands are accelerating the transition of foundation models toward federated edge deployments, while theory, principled frameworks, and empirical understanding remain largely limited.

        <p>
          To meet privacy, latency, and bandwidth requirements, foundation models are increasingly being deployed toward edge environments. However, existing federated learning frameworks are not designed to support foundation models under edge constraints. The scale of foundation models, combined with limited computation, communication, and energy resources at the edge, introduces tremendous new challenges. This workshop aims to provide a focused forum on federated foundation models at the network edge. We encourage submissions on novel algorithmic design, fundamental trade-offs, and real-world deployments of federated learning and on-device foundation models, including but not limited to
